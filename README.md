# ðŸ–Œ Introduction to Computer Science - Learn Python

## Welcome !

This is an appreciative teacher's modified rewrite of a curriculum originally developed by Microsoft TEALS. The original implementation was for the second semester of a year-long course, Repl.it Classroom still existed, and online learning wasn't as robust as it is currently.

Fast forward to this day: _Repl.it_ is now _Replit_, Repl.it Classroom has now been integrated into Replit Teams, and there are many more features that Replit has developed in order to include as many coders online as much as possible.

#### How to use this resource

* Please use the navigation to the left. You can find usage and disclaimers in About
* Concepts are broken up into units. You can view the curriculum map to see objectives and standards alignment with CSTA.
* Each lesson has its own pages for instructor notes which double as student directions, and the student's `main.py`.
* The lessons have been rewritten to be more self-paced and less instructor-led to adapt to varying student experience levels.
