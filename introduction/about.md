# About

This course is an adaptation of the [**Microsoft TEALS Introduction to Computer Science Curriculum: Second Semester - Python**](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science)**\*** and is written for a wide range of students with diverse computer science backgrounds.&#x20;

\*The original GitBook has been deprecated after the 2019-2020 school year. The original curriculum was intended for use by Microsoft TEALS in classrooms teaching Intro to Computer Science in a year long format. This document only utilizes the second semester.

<summary>How to use this curriculum</summary>

If you are here, these are the things that are assumed to have been completed:

* You are a teacher who is willing to work out and develop the solutions on your own
* Your students have access to a **non-tablet** computer (PC or Mac, it doesn't matter)
* You are using Replit Teams for Education
* Everyone has internet access

What is provided:

* `instructions.md`: Lesson notes, available to students as a completed file and only editable by the instructor
* `main.py`: What the students see when they open up their `main.py` or project in Teams
* If additional notes are needed for the instructor, they will be provided on the individual lesson's page.

All markdown is available via GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/elykittytee/learn-python).

_I will not post or share personally created answer keys, starter code, or code solutions publicly or share them with those who request. It is the instructor's responsibility to adapt and practice the examples for usage in their classrooms._

<summary>Using the markdown files within Replit Teams for Education</summary>

When creating a new project, include the `assets` folder in the lesson. The file manager will expand to include `assets` for the instructor and open the folder where you can place these files. Pay attention to the file tree. _Students cannot see the contents of the `assets` folder, so it is imperative to preview the lesson as a student prior to administering the lesson_.
