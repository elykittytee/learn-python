Feel free to adapt to your own classroom.

<details>

<summary>Hello World</summary>

* [ ] Introduce Python, what it means, what it can be used for
* [ ] Have everyone observe the code. Encourage new coders to make sense of it.
  * [ ] Introduce `comments`
  * [ ] Have the students add a comment of their observations into `main.py`
* [ ] &#x20; Introduce the parts of `IDE`
* [ ] Run the `hello world` program
  * [ ] Copy the program code from Python/`IDE` Intro above into the `IDE`
  * [ ] Talk about it. No, really.

<summary>Interacting with the Console</summary>

* [ ] Display the IDE
  * [ ] Review with students, identify the key parts (menu bar items \[run, console, +], code panel, console panel).
* [ ] After going over the three parts of the IDE have students check that they can still log into their IDE account.
* [ ] Complete the Guided activity, Part 1 of the lab
  * [ ] Have students all bring up their console on their computer.
  * [ ] The part on right half of the screen is called a **console**
  * [ ] The **console** is a place where you can interact with a program
  * [ ] The **interpreter** runs Python code.
  * [ ] To run the Python interpreter, type code into the console and hit "Enter" or click "Run", the code executes immediately.
  *   [ ] Make sure all the students are able to do this and then give out the lab worksheet.

      ####
* [ ] Give students time to work on section 1.
  * [ ] Discuss with students the discussion questions. Have them answer as a comment on `main.py`
*   [ ] Go over the following two terms:

    1. **Floats**: a data type, number with a decimal point.
    2. **Integers**: a data type, number without a decimal point.


* [ ] Give students time to work on section 2
  * [ ] Discuss with students the discussion questions. Have them answer as a comment on `main.py`
  * [ ] Go over **String**: a data type, characters surrounded in single or double quotes.



*   [ ] Give students time to work on section 3.

    * [ ] Discuss with students the discussion questions. Have them answer as a comment on `main.py`
    * [ ] Go over **Concatentation**: Strings can be combined using `+`.


* [ ] Give students time to work on section 4.



* [ ] Discuss with students the Order of Operations is the same as what students have learned in math class.



* [ ] Go over the instructions for part 2 of the lab
  * [ ] Make sure students write down their predictions before going to the interpreter/IDE to check the actual output.
  * [ ] Ask students to give an example of an expression.
  * [ ] Define **expression**: a combination of values and operators (and variables)



* [ ] Debrief with students
  * [ ] Discuss any surprising/unexpected results
  * [ ] Talk about how single and double quotes are interchangeable.&#x20;
  * [ ] Show an example of multiplying strings.
  * [ ] Discuss why it might be helpful to have an interactive console.
